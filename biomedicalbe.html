Biomedical engineering may be defined as the application of engineering to medicine. Biomedical engineers apply the concepts of biology as well as physics and chemistry to develop products and devices, which are used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.A Biomedical Engineer uses traditional engineering expertise to analyze and solve problems in biology and medicine, providing an overall enhancement of health care. The biomedical engineer works with other health care professionals including physicians, nurses, therapists and technicians.<br>
<br>
1) Companies manufacturing equipment used in hospitals and diagnostic centres. Here you may work in the research and development (R&D), manufacturing, quality control and testing, installation, maintenance or sales and marketing departments.<br>
<br>
2) Large hospitals to select, handle and maintain sophisticated equipment. You will also build customized devices for special needs.<br>
<br>
3) Government agencies where you will be involved in product testing and safety, as well as establishing safety standards for devices.<br>
