In a layman’s term, biology is the study of life. It studies the life of living creatures from the simplest unicellular organisms to complex animal species. To describe further, a biologist studies the contact of biological system with their surroundings and focuses on applying biological concepts to solve certain practical problems.

<div class="boxmods">
<br>
<p>

Biology is a broad and multi-faceted subject with many interdisciplinary branches such as:<br>
<br>
• Molecular biology<br>
<br>
• Animal physiology<br>
<br>
• Genetics and genetic engineering<br>
<br>
• Marine science<br>
<br>
• Zoology<br>
<br>
• Environmental biology and ecology<br>
<br>
• Forensic science<br>
<br>
A bachelor’s degree course in zoology comprises the various aspects of animal science. Food production, conservation of the environment and health of living beings (both humans and animals) are the important knowledge that zoology gives.<br>
<br>
Botany deals with plant biology starting from molecular biology and the tiniest green single cell organisms to the tallest trees. Molecular biology & genetics is the study of all aspects of the cell and the courses it undertakes.<br>
<br>
Genetics involves new developments such as genetic engineering, transgenic animals (containing genetic material transferred from another species) and genetically modified plants.<br>
<br>
Environmental biology examines the contact between organisms and their natural and artificial environments. Its knowledge is essential in understanding and controlling various environmental issues of the world.<br>
<br>
At present, biology has become one of the most important and rapidly changing sciences. Biologists work in numerous areas that include working on environmental issues that affect or lives, like the global warming. They work hard to ensure better health and quality of lives for us and also for the future generation.<br>
<br>
Job Opportunity:<br>
<br>
Industries and organizations related to pharmaceutics, agricultural chemicals, biotechnology, food processing and storage, brewing, bio deterioration and pest control, sewage and water treatment employ biologists.<br>
<br>
Zoologists are employed in the following field too- conservation & management of wildlife, agriculture to pest control, forensic science to the chemical industry, laboratory based research to medical research, marine biology, academics, journalism, film production in association with and wildlife photography etc.<br>
<br>
Botanists can work as environmental consultants, pollution biologists, molecular biologists, plant molecular biologists and cell biologists. Compared to the past, career opportunities for botanists have increased manifold, with many botanists recruited in rapidly expanding areas such as plant genetics and biotechnology.<br>
<br>
Oceanography, marine biology, high altitude biology and environmental biology are some of the branches of biology that offer new and exciting careers.<br>
<br>
Career Prospects:<br>
<br>
Biological problems appear regularly on front pages in leading newspapers as society strives to come to terms with advances in our understanding of health, genetics, the environment and the efforts to conserve our earth’s biodiversity. Saving endangered species, feeding people, curing diseases etc are some of the issues where the services of biologists are much sought after. Therefore, biology as a career is quite challenging and at the same time rewarding too. Biologists are much demand in today’s world.<br>

<h1>QUALIFICATIONS</h1>
<div class="boxmode">

<p>

To become a biologist, the basic requirement is a bachelor’s degree in life sciences like zoology, botany, biotechnology etc. You can pursue a master’s degree course in the same. If you are interested in doing further studies after your master’s degree, you can opt for a PhD program in the same.<br>

<h1>SALARY</h1>
<div class="boxmode">
<p>


Salary for a Biologist varies depending on the educational qualification and experience. It also depends on the area of specialization and nature of work. Biologist who are employed by research and development departments can earn handsome packages. Initially, they can expect a salary of Rs.12000 -18000 per month. However, after 5-7 years, they can expect much better salaries.<br>
<br>
It is worthwhile to mention that biologist who are employed by big organization abroad can expect more than Rs. 75000 per month.
