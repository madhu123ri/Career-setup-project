Just like other forms of medicine, Ayurvedic doctors examine the patients and document their medical history. The diagnosis involves consideration of the entire history of the patient. For this a comprehensive knowledge of the physical, physiological and mental state of the patient is gathered and systematically recorded.<br>
<br>
Details about the patient’s temperament, habits, diet, external living conditions and details about the disease itself are recorded. After diagnosis, the doctor prescribes the appropriate medication and other remedial measures. An important part of the job is to explain the dosage of medicines and effect of the therapy to the patient.<br>
