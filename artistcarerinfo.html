<p>


Fine art includes drawing, painting and sculpting. Trying to express a specific and unique vision through painting, sculpture, drawing, or mixed media characterises an artist's life.<br>
<br>
Commercial art is the application of various art media for commercial purposes like creating attractive illustrations for advertisements, displays, books, magazines, posters, packaging, etc.<br>
<br>
The extension of these arts to the industrial field translates to exhibitions, window displays, hoardings, technical catalogues, cinema slides, etc.<br>
<br>
Fine Arts could be broadly classified into Painting and Sculpting.<br>
<br>
Painting: It involves painting or sketching portraits, landscapes, scenery, still life, abstract design, murals, etc. The medium could be watercolours, oil paints or even pastel colours charcoal and even computer paint programmes. Your choice of surfaces could vary from the traditional canvas to creating graffiti walls a La New York.<br>
<br>
Sculpting: You will use your hands to give shape to your thoughts. Material like stone, wood, clay, plaster of Paris or metals such as bronze will be your resources. Computers, lasers, sound, plastics, fibre and textiles are some other materials you could dabble with. Successful sculptors continually study and learn new techniques, experiment with different materials, keep abreast with world trends and attend art exhibitions.<br>
<br>
Pottery: You could also take up pottery and create designer pots. You'll keep yourself busy with throwing, glazing and firing pots. Many potters consider pottery as more of a lifestyle than a career even though they may have their wares located across the nation in speciality shops or art studios.<br>
<br>
In fine arts unless you are a M.F Hussein or an Anjali Ela Menon, you don't really have much opportunity to make mega bucks. So you better find yourself a proper job to fall back on. But if art is what you live for you could earn a decent living as an artist too.<br>
<br>
You can offer your skills and vision to commercial clients like corporations, retail stores, advertising agencies, design houses or publishing firms. If you don't want to be tied up in a full-time job you could work be a freelancer, or work for an advertising agency, graphic-design firm or other organisation that has an advertising department on a part time basis.<br>
<br>
Commercial art involves using different art forms for creating advertisements, billboards, book jackets, window displays, cinema slides, technical catalogues, packaging and so on. You will use your creativity skills to give form to someone else's ideas.<br>
<br>
To join this field, apart from being a good artist, you also need to understand the art of marketing and publicity. Selling your skills at times affects your ability to produce your own work. But this is where the moolah is. Apart from this you can also work on other forms of art like cartooning, computer animation, clay modelling and so on.<br>
<br>
Job Opportunities:<br>
<br>
As a sculptor, you could design themes for worldwide events, seasons, specific promotions or a particular message. Sculpting is not a career, which can be taken up off-hand. It is an art that has more to do with in-born talent.<br>
<br>
Specialists in Fine Arts can work as freelancers or can be employed by TV and film studios. They can teach art at the school level.<br>
<br>
Specialists in commercial art have various job openings:<br>
<br>
• Art studios<br>
<br>
• Advertising agencies<br>
<br>
• Publishing houses<br>
<br>
• Departments of commercial establishments, etc.<br>
<br>
• Fashion houses<br>
<br>
• Art critics<br>
<br>
You can also earn money by being a freelancer. Art and culture is getting increasing attention in the media these days. You could even write features and articles for newspapers and magazines.<br>
<br>
Career Prospects:<br>
<br>
The methods and mediums of art may change, but the intention has remained the same: to reinvent, to communicate in a new and fascinating way. In the future, the role that art plays will not change drastically, but painting, photography, sketching, sculpting, metalworking, and many other mediums will be joined by computer art.<br>
<br>
This is an industry where your reputation counts a lot. You need to produce work that creates hype and buzz in the artistic community. Your contacts in the advertising business and art dealers should get you steady amount of work. Be prepared for a lot of frustration though. You may not always get what you want. Corporate support and encouragement to artists is also on the rise.<br>

<br>
Initially you'll have to start your career by presenting your works to people for free! You could exhibit your work in a gallery and earn anything between Rs 10000 – 15000 on an individual piece of work. Gradually, this could move on to the Rs 30000- 45000 bracket. Once your work is recognised then an individual piece could cost up to Rs 2 lakh or more.<br>
