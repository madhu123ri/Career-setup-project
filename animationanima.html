Animation is basically giving motion to an object. To animate means to give appearance of movement using varying drawings. Animators create sequence of motion picture art that tell a story or communicate a message. Traditional animators used to draw each pictures individually on paper, which where then transferred into film, and when played back rapidly gave the effect of motion. However, with the advent of technology, the majority of the animator’s work is done with the help of computers.<br>
