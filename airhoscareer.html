<h1 class="h1"><i>What is this actually </i></h1>
<div class="boxmods">
<br>
<p>
First, let's clear your head of some glaring misconceptions. Air hostesses DON'T lead glamorous lives. Nor is it a cakewalk in the air. Your job profile ranges from passenger safety to good public relations. It's your job to make people feel comfortable during the flight and ensure their safety at all times. You got to be strong enough to lift heavy containers and slim enough to glide through the aisle and in between carts.<br>
<br>
As an air hostess, your duty starts much before take-off. You have to reach the airport an hour-and-a-half before check-in time and undergo briefing by the senior flight attendant. Briefing includes a basic lecture on safety, take-off and service procedures during the flight.<br>
<br>
Flight attendants often spend up to half of their working hours preparing the cabin for flight, writing reports and doing other related work on the ground. Flight attendants need to have excellent communication skills, tactful, well groomed and enjoy taking a methodical approach to their work. While this is a mere formality as far as domestic flights are concerned, it is advisable to know your stuff thoroughly if you're flying international.<br>
<br>
That's not all. As an air hostess, you also have to run a safety check on the aircraft. This includes testing safety equipment, life jackets, mikes, etc. Ensuring that pillows, blankets, books, food, plates, glasses, napkins and medicines are in stock is also part and parcel of the job. The final check includes making sure that the aircraft has been cleaned and is ready for boarding<br>
<br>
It's after boarding that your real duties begin. After handing over the boarding passes, the air hostess has to assist passengers and help them settle down in their seats. Then comes the most boring part of explaining safety procedures and building a rapport with the passengers as, after all, you will be serving them for the next several hours.<br>
<br>
However, it's not as easy as it sounds. Dealing with different passengers can be one hell of a trying experience. If you're lucky, you won't have more than two to three troublemakers on a flight.<br>
<br>
The longest shift for a domestic hostess can be about 5-6 hours but international hostesses have to serve for 12-15 hours at a stretch. Phew! Now that can be really very tiring. Add to that an emergency like a medical problem or a hijack and you are left handling 200 passengers all at the same time.<br>
<br>
The highs in this career are worth talking about. Think of all the kinds of people you'll meet right from the businessmen to film stars and even VVIPs! Of course, as an air hostess, you'll see all the exotic destinations, stay in 5-star hotels and shop at some of the best malls in the world. And we haven't even spoken about the money yet. At the end of the month, you take home an attractive pay packet.<br>
<br>
Job Opportunities:<br>
<br>
As an air hostess you can start off work in the economy class of a flight. After a year or so you will then progress to the business class and then to the First Class. You can then become a supervisor and finally a chief purser - incharge of the whole aircraft.<br>
<br>
It usually takes about seven years and a good track record to become a purser. All through the years, the airlines you are working for as an air hostess will offer various training and skill development programmes.<br>
<br>
Most airlines recruit staff on a contract basis for about 2-3 years and as an air hostess you will be bound to the airline till the contract expires. Some places you'll be working are:<br>
<br>
• Government owned carriers: Indian (formerly known as Indian Airlines), Air India and their subsidiaries like Alliance Air.<br>
<br>
• Domestic private airlines: Sahara India, Jet Airways, Go Air, etc.<br>
<br>
• Foreign Airlines operating from India like British Airways, Qantas Airlines, Delta Airlines, Gulf Air, Singapore Airlines, United Air, Lufthansa, Cathay Pacific, etc.<br>
<br>
• Corporate companies with their own private jets like Tata, Mahindra & Mahindra, etc.<br><br>
<br>
You could also opt for another glamorous and exciting career similar to that of an air hostess known as “Passenger service agent”. A passenger service agent is essentially a facilitation agent doing, at the airport what the flight attendants do in the aircraft. Your duties would include greeting the passenger the moment he/she enters the airport, see them through baggage screening, check-in, preparing boarding passes etc. As a Passenger service agent, you will also assist them and ensure smooth sailing through Immigration, customs and finally the boarding on the aircraft.<br>
<br>
Career prospects:<br>
<br>
Though the trade pundits have announced a slump in the domestic air traffic industry, as an air hostess you have no cause for worry. As far as people wish to fly there will be demand for air hostess. Or just look at the increase in the number of airlines operating in the regional trunk routes like Calcutta - Bagdogra, New Delhi - Shimla, Mumbai - Hubli, Mumbai - Nagpur, etc.<br>
<br>
Airlines like Alliance Air are operating in these routes and several others are planning to do so. This will also mean an increased demand for aircrew including air hostesses. Apart from domestic airlines, it is always possible to get a job as an air hostess in foreign Airlines or in Air India and Indian, which operate, on international routes.<br>

<h1>SALARY</h1>
<div class="boxmode">
<p>


As an air hostess your designation your salary will depend on the airlines. Including salary and other allowance it may add up to Rs 25000-75000 or more per month.<br>
<br>
Senior air hostess in Air India or Indian Airlines gets Rs 100000 per month.<br>
<br>
Senior air hostess with foreign airlines gets Rs 200000 or more a month in Indian currency. Junior domestic hostesses get Rs 25000 a month.<br>
<br>
The money scene is any day better in international airlines and as an air hostess you could earn a minimum of Rs 50000 per month if you're working with a reputed airline.<br>
<br>
However, you must remember that you cannot fly for more than 72 hours in a month. So this would greatly limit the amount of money you can make, especially if you're flying with a not-so-reputed airline.<br>
