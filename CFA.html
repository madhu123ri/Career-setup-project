<p><b>TOPICS:</b></p>

<p><u><i>Ethics and Professional Standards</i></u>

This section covers the code of ethics, professional standards and the global investment performance standards. Ethics is one section that is equally important in all of the three levels. The questions will be aimed at the application of the seven standards in professional situations. Other important topics are the soft dollars and Research Objectivity Standards (ROS).
</p>
<p><i><u>Quantitative Methods</u></i>

You can expect about one to two item sets from the quants section. The case statement will most likely present data, for example, regression and ask you to analyze and interpret the data. You may even be asked to calculate some key metrics based on the data provided.
</p>
<p>
<i><u>Economics</u></i>

Similar to quants, economics is also a small section in Level II. You can expect one item set for this topic. You need to have a good conceptual knowledge of economics, as many of these concepts can be tested along with other topics. One important concept is foreign exchange and you are likely to be tested on the application of its concepts.

</p>

<p><u><i>Financial Reporting and Analysis</i></u>
This is probably the largest section on the exam, with 20% of the questions being on this topic. Reporting and analysis are also weighted about the same for the Level II course, so it's important to spend enough time studying this area to build a solid foundation for subsequent exams. You will be asked to interpret the three financial statements (balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement), know the ratios and many other advanced concepts such as revenue recognition, inventory analysis, long-term assets and taxes. Since the exam is a global exam, it does not cover local accounting practices. The focus is more on widely accepted standards such as U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
</p>
<p><u><i>Corporate Finance</i></u>
After financial reporting and analysis comes corporate finance. This is a short section with only an 7% weightage. The key topics include agency problems related to agency-principal relationship, capital budgeting, cost of capital, leverage and working capital management.
</p>

<p>
<u><i>Portfolio Management
</i></u>
The Level I exam only introduces you to the basics of portfolio management. The important concepts are Modern Portfolio Theory and the Capital Asset Pricing Model. There will be about 17 questions in this section. This section acts as a preparation for Levels II and III, where the focus is more on the application of all your knowledge on portfolio management.
</p>

<p><u><i>Equity Investments</u></i>
Equities is an important section for financial analysts and you can expect about four to five item set questions from equities. There is a lot of material on equity analysis and valuation methods. Note that the equity section is heavy on formulas and you may be asked to perform formula-based calculations and interpretations
