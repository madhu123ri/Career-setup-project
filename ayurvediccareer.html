<div class="boxmods">
<br>
<p>

The system of medicine known as ayurveda is considered to be indigenous to India. The primary reference materials for a practitioner are ancient treatises like Charaka Samhita. Literally translated, ayurveda means "Knowledge of Life." Ayu means life and veda is knowledge in Sanskrit. Those who wish to become an ayurvedic doctor should be aware of these facts.<br>
<br>
On a more deeper level, it means 'the science of living". Ayurveda shows one the way of living a complete and productive life. Experts also claim that Ayurveda prevents diseases. A large part of an ayurvedic doctor's work is devoted to curing, which is known as Kayachikitsa<br>.
<br>
Those who wish to become an ayurvedic doctor should be aware of the philosophy of Ayurveda, which is based on Panch Mahabhutas of which the body is composed of. A healthy person is one in whom there is equilibrium of the humours and body tissues with normal digestive as well as excretory functions, which are responses to gratification of physical sciences and mental as well as spiritual forces. Absence of this equilibrium describes the status of diseases or sickness. The Vat, Pitta, Kapha are known as three humours. In a healthy person these are non-functional equilibrium, and loss of it leads to sickness.<br>
<br>
There are four key concepts in Ayurveda. These concepts are Panch Mahabhutas, Tridoshas, Sapt Dhatus and Malas. These altogether guide the preventive, promotive and curative aspects of the practice of Ayurveda.<br>
<br>
PANCH MAHABHUTAS<br>
<br>
These refer to five basic elements of air, water, fire, earth and sky. Creation of all forms of life including human life is credited to these elements. Those who intend to become an ayurvedic doctor should be aware these panch mahabhutas.<br>
<br>
TRIDOSHAS AND DHATUS<br>
<br>
These two concepts together explain all the physiological and biological aspects taking place in living body. The Tridoshas are Vat, Pitta and Kapha. These three terms are broadly comparable to the modern concepts of motion, energy and inertia respectively.<br>
<br>
DHATUS<br>
<br>
An ayurvedic doctor deals with dhatus, which are vital body organs or parts. These are Rasa (body fluid), Rakta (blood), Mansa (muscular tissues) Meda (edipose tissue), Asthi (bone tissue), Majja (nerve tissue and bone marrow) and Shukra (generative tissue including sperm and ova).<br>
<br>
MALAS<br>
<br>
This concept deals with the waste products of the body. The food consumption by human body brings into existence and place further the above mention seven Dhatus or vital body organs. During this metabolic process each organ produces specific waste or malla such stool, urine, sweat, nails, hair etc.<br>
<br>
An ayurvedic doctor's treatment is of two types, one which includes cleansing and purification and the other which reduces the intensity of the disease. Ayurveda uses the medicinal properties of plants. Sometimes, special massages and other techniques are used to alleviate pain.<br>
<br>
The success of the science has been recorded in the curing of rheumatoid arthritis, liver and gastro-intestinal problems, skin diseases and other chronic illnesses.<br>
<br>
Method of Treatment<br>
<br>
Like in any form of medicine, Ayurvedic doctors examine the patient and document his/her medical history. The diagnosis involves consideration of the entire humanity. These include details of the man's temperament, his habits, diet etc. For this a comprehensive knowledge about the physical, physiological and mental state of the patient is gathered and systematically recorded. Details about the persons temperament, his habits, diet, external living conditions and details about the disease itself are recorded.<br>
<br>
Examination of the patient generally involves one or more of the following:<br>
<br>
• Pulse examination to find out which of the three 'Dosha or Doshas' have lost equilibrium or balance causing the person to become sick.<br>
<br>
• Urine examination.<br>
<br>
• Examination of the stool.<br>
<br>
• Examination of the tongue.<br>
<br>
• Eye examination.<br>
<br>
• Examination through auscultation.<br>
<br>
• Examination of tactile stimulation.<br>
<br>
• Examination of part or parts of the body.<br>
<br>
An ayurvedic doctor, based on the above examinations confirms and sharpens the diagnosis.<br>
<br>
After diagnosing to determine the exact cause of the illness doctors prescribe the right medication and/or other remedial measures. An important part of the job is to explain to the patient the dosage of medicines and effect of the therapy and communicating to him in a way he understands the directions and instructions to be followed. This could well do half the job for both the therapist and the patient, for a simple direct communication opens the patient to the therapist and instills in the patient confidence in both the system and the therapist.<br>
<br>
Job Opportunities<br>
<br>
For qualified practitioners of the various systems, there are openings in government hospitals, charitable medical centers, private clinics, hospitals and dispensaries. In government hospitals, Ayurvedic practitioners are on par with allopaths.<br>
<br>
Teaching and research at research institutions is another options open to qualified Ayurvedic doctors.<br>
<br>
Of course private practice is the best option. The first step to establish a clientele is to offer services to friends and neighbors either free of cost or at discounted rates. Once the credibility is established, word of mouth can do wonders.<br>
<br>
Career Prospects<br>
<br>
Traditional medicine is gaining popularity and hard core advocates and followers of Allopathy are beginning to recognize and follow many of the systems of alternative medicine. The main reason being the fact that Ayurvedic medicines are devoid of side effects. Ayurvedic medicines are made from natural herbs and are 100 per cent safe. Another reason, perhaps is that, in India, a large part of the population cannot bear the cost of allopathic treatment, which has gone sky high over the last few years.<br>
<br>
Ayurvedic medicine is now catching on in a big way, with more and more people realizing the importance of keeping the body, mind and spirit in balance. Traditional Medicine has always upheld the belief that good health is not merely absence of illness. Scientific research has lent validity to these streams of Traditional Medicine through research and study. This healing system is now part of an international industry.<br>
