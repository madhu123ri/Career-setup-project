In 1965, the government constituted the Border Security Force to man the extensive national boundaries, security of the border regions as well as to control any activities, which could threaten our defence structure. Since then the Border Security Force has grown into the largest Para-military force of India.<br>
<br>
The Border Security Force has three main operational arms:<br>
<br>
• The General Duty branch, which is in charge of vigilance.<br>
<br>
• The Technical branch, which maintains equipments, telecommunication networks and is also in charge of construction work.<br>
<br>
• The Medical branch, which provides all kinds of medical facilities to BSF troops as well as civilians.<br>
<br>
The Border Security Force has been entrusted with the task of:<br>
<br>
• Keeping vigil on the borders and protecting people in border areas.<br>
<br>
• Preventing trans-border crimes, unauthorized entry or exit, smuggling and related illegal activities.<br>
<br>
• Providing intelligence reports from the border regions<br>
<br>
• Protecting vital installations and major operational areas such as bridges, roads, airstrips, etc.<br>
<br>
• Providing protection to people in border areas.<br>
<br>

<br>
As a part of the Border Security Force, you will have to patrol mountainous terrains, deserts and long coastal stretches on camel back, horseback, on foot, speedboats or in helicopters.<br>
<br>
During war-time you will be required to hold ground in less threatened sectors so long as the main attack does not develop in a particular sector. Protection of vital installations against enemy commando raids will also form part of your responsibilities in the Border Security Force.<br>
<br>
Apart from being deployed on the border, as a part of the Border Security Force, you will also be required to carry out internal security, anti-infiltration and counter insurgency roles.<br>
<br>
Civil, electronic and electrical engineers find employment in the technical branch. One of the most important departments of this particular branch of the Border Security Force is the Signals Arm. Here, you will be in-charge of the line of communication for passing information on matters relating to internal security.<br>
<br>
In the Medical Branch you will be required to take care of Border Security Force personnel as well as civilians. You will dispense medicines to the civilian population as well as attend to the sick.<br>
<br>
In addition you will be involved in numerous civic actions. These include developmental works, providing assistance during natural calamities, supplying essential commodities like sugar, kerosene oil, etc.<br>
<br>
Job Opportunity<br>
<br>
BSF men and women are required to be a perfect policeman during peace and a professional soldier during war. Management of international borders, restoration of law and order situation in the interior and fighting a conventional/unconventional war are the major challenges faced by today's BSF personnel.<br>
<br>

<br>
Assistant Commandants with minimum B.Sc. (Physics, Chemistry & Mathematics) with Electronics are deputed as Assistant Commandant (Technical) after undergoing further technical courses.<br>
<br>
After successful completion of the training these officers are put on 'general duty,' which apart from normal field duties involves administrative responsibilities. Managerial and administrative responsibilities increase with seniority and promotions.<br>
<br>
You will mostly be deployed on the Western borders with Pakistan or on the Eastern borders with Bangladesh. In addition you may also be deployed in internal security duties during general elections and law and order problems such as riots. In states like Jammu and Kashmir and Assam, you will be involved in anti-militancy operations.<br>
<br>
From time to time you will be required to do advanced courses in counter insurgency and commando operations, specialized weapons training, etc.<br>
