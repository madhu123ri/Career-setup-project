Biotechnology is an interdisciplinary, covering biomedical research, microbiology, physics, chemistry, mathematics and engineering. A biotechnologist is essentially involved in manipulating or re-engineering biochemical processes or genetic codes of cells to produce products, which are beneficial to mankind. They are also involved in gene therapy, fertility control, improving food nutritional value, reducing pollution, increasing livestock productivity, development of contraceptives, etc.<br>
<br>
1) Some broad areas of work for an agricultural scientist includes research in fertilizers and seeds to increase the yield and quality of crops; research in plant genetics and breeding; research in agricultural economics and study and implementation of findings in plant pathology. Other areas of work include Soil Science, erosion and conversion and Water management<br>
<br>
2) Seek employment in zoos, national parks, wildlife centers, race clubs and stud farms<br>
<br>
3) Join veterinary hospitals, primary vet centers, colleges, semen banks, sperm stations, poultry and dairy farms, veterinary instruments, milk processing plants, vaccine plants, pharmaceutical companies, feed processing industry etc<br>
<br>
4) Other areas: Include working in media houses like newspapers, magazines and journals as journalists to write and report exclusively on environmental issues; imparting education in colleges, universities, schools and community clubs; eco-tourism etc<br>
