<p>"Did the scene surprise you where a million rats invade a pastry shop in the latest Shahrukh Khan blockbuster? Have you watched animated films like The Lion King and Toy Story a dozen times? And then wondered how that happens?<br>
<br>
Well, it's called animation, and what's more, it's possible for you to do it too!"<br>

<h1 class="h1"><i>What is this actually </i></h1>
<div class="boxmods">
<br>
<p>Animation is basically giving motion to an object. To animate means to give appearance of movement using varying drawings. Drawing each and every frame individually with gradual variation does it. The procedure is hard, and requires patience. The drawings are then played at the desired speed, which makes its look smooth.<br>
<br>
Animators create sequences of motion picture art that tell a story or communicate a message. Traditional animators used to draw each picture individually on paper, which were then transferred onto film, and when played back rapidly (about 25 frames per second), gave the effect of motion.<br>
<br>
Animators work as a team. Basically, the work consists of making drawings and working under a supervising animator, who usually gives out the scenes that are shorter, and works on the longer ones himself. Animators do the acting, gestures, mouth shapes, but are not responsible for every single drawing in the scene. One second of 35-mm film can consist of 24 frames, but lots of people work on it.<br>
<br>
Most animators say it's a rewarding experience. The work is not as technical as it sounds. It requires more of creativity. It gets technical though in certain scenes, when you have to keep track of the character walking in front of a moving background, especially if the character is also moving towards and away from the camera. To excel in this field you have to know the character you are animating - how they'd respond or react to something.<br>
<br>
Animation scenes are denoted by number of feet, so you're responsible for certain amount of footage. Four to eight feet will take you about a week.<br>
<br>
There are various forms of animation, such as Clay Animation, Puppet Animation and two and three Dimensional Animation (responsible for Classics like The Lion King, or the path breaking Stuart little).<br>
<br>
Job Opportunities:<br>
<br>
A major chunk of the work happens to be in the advertising agencies. You'll be involved in making short animation films for ads. Even independent television and film production houses employ animators to produce cartoon film and the likes.<br>
<br>
There are also some animation studios and multimedia design agencies specialising in animation. Once you are known in the industry, you can also get into freelancing.<br>
<br>
Career Prospects:<br>
<br>
In India, the scope for professional animators is mostly restricted to the field of advertising. But then, the film and television segments are growing.<br>
<br>
The animation industry the world over is also growing. With the development of requisite skills, Indian companies are bagging orders for animation production from advanced countries due to cheaper costs. As a result, there is a growing demand for talented animators with the right software skills. This trend is expected to continue in the future."<br>

<h1>ABILITIES & TRAITS REQUIRED</h1>
<div class="boxmode">





<p>For a bright career in animation you need:<br>
<br>
A good hand at sketching<br>
<br>
Strong imagination, visualisation, and illustration skills<br>
<br>
Patience<br></p>
<br>
</div>
<br>
<h1>QUALIFICATIONS</h1>
<div class="boxmode">

<p>
"To make a mark in this line a course in animation is necessary. In fact a graduate course in Animation Design from an institution like National Institute of Design will help you to make a good beginning. When you join as a trainee, you get to learn more. It's all based on the strength of your drawing and imagination. What you essentially need is talent and a good knowledge of computer based animation packages.<br>
<br>
However, these days, with the advent of powerful computers and software such as 3D Studio Max, Alias, etc, nearly all animation work is being done on the computer. What's more, animation is even taught to kids, as they grasp much faster and are more interested in animation as compared to adults.<br>
<br>
If you are looking for a professional course in animation, beware of the numerous multimedia academies that offer to teach you animation. Most of them only teach you the bare technical basics and lack qualified, talented faculty. It is wise to ascertain the competence and experience of the faculty in teaching the software packages before signing up at any of those institutes.<br>
<br>
You will do well if you have a graduate diploma in Visual Communication Design from National Institute of Design with specialisation in Animation Design/ Bachelor of Design from IIT-Guwahati/ Master of Design from IIT-Mumbai.<br>

<h1>SALARY</h1>
<div class="boxmode">

<p>
"As a fresher, you'll be expected to put in long hours of work for meager Rs 15000 – 18000 per month depending on your talent. However, once you have acquired the skill in using high-end animation software, the salary increases rapidly. It could be anything between Rs 20000 - 30000 a month.<br>
<br>
There is good scope for freelancing. Here you could be drawing more than an experienced animator. Working as a professional in a studio or a firm as a freelancers, you can charge anything around Rs 50000 – 60000 or more for a 30 second film (depending on the animation required)."<br>
