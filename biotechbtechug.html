Biotechnology is a fusion of biology and technology. As a biotechnologist you will be responsible for providing biological solutions with the help of advanced technology. It is a technique that uses living organisms or their products to make or modify a product, to improve plant or animals, or to develop microorganisms for specific uses. The cloned "Dolly the Sheep" was a miracle brought by genetic engineering (a sub- branch of Bio-technology).<br>
<br>
1) Research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, chemical industries, agriculture and allied industries<br>
<br>
2) There are several research organisations in the areas of bioscience and biotechnology under CSIR (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research), ICAR (Indian Council for Agricultural Research) and other such research organisations. These include Center for Cellular & Molecular Biology, Institute of Microbial Technology, Central for Plant Biotechnology, Central Drug Research Institute, National Institute of Nutrition, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, National central for Biology Sciences, Potato Research Institute, Tobacco Research Institute, etc.<br>
<br>
3) Pharmaceutical companies, food processing companies, and other companies involved in bioprocess technology such as. Ranbaxy, Cadila, Wockhardt, Pfizer, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratory, Sun Pharmaceutical, Lupin Laboratories and others like Monsanto, Shanta Biotechniques, Proagro, Mahyco are also involved in biotechnology research and utilize the professional services of qualified biotechnologist and bioinformatists.<br>
