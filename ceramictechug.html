Ceramic engineering deals with the study of the properties, manufacture, design and applications of ceramics elements in a wide range of consumer and industrial products ranging from table and sanitary ware to diodes and semi-conductors, irrigation pipes and construction material to components for nuclear and computer hardware, besides dentistry and a host of other applications.<br>
<br>
Ceramics have applications in virtually any industry, which demands the use of heat-resistant materials. Ceramic technologists are specialists in the study of these materials, their behavior, application, and use. Ceramic Technologists are mainly engaged in research, product development, and production engineering.<br>
<br>
Ceramic Technologists can specialize in white wares (porcelain and china dinnerware or high voltage electrical insulators), structural materials (brick, tile and turbine blades), electronic ceramics (magnetics, memory systems and microwave devices), protective and refractory coatings for metals, glass products, abrasives and fuel elements for nuclear energy.<br>
<br>
Ceramic Engineers are employed in industries producing glass, cement, porcelain, enamel refractory, iron and steel and in industries manufacturing special ceramics for power and nuclear energy projects, aerospace, R & D laboratories and defence establishments.<br>
