Civil Engineers also develop and maintain the nation's vital transportation and other infrastructure networks, improve public services, optimise the use of water and energy resources, upgrade housing and mass transportation systems and protect natural environment. Structural engineering, water management engineering, highway engineering and environmental engineering are some of the areas civil engineers specialize in.<br>
