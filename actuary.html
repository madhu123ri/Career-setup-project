Actuaries are professionals who use their mathematics and statistics skills to understand, assess and solve problems related to the financial impact of risk and uncertainty. They create mathematical models of events and the world around us, thereby helping us take informed decisions which will lead to the least probability of financial losses. In simple words - every business faces risk and uncertainty. Actuaries help in understanding the uncertainty and in taking more informed decisions.

The Actuarial profession gains a formal presence in 1848 after the Institute of Actuaries is established in London.<br>
In India, the Actuarial Society of India (ASI) is established in 1944 and included in the international governing body of actuaries, the International Actuarial Association (IAA), in 1979. Traditionally, the actuarial profession was limited to the insurance sector but now, it expands to other industries as well.<br>
<br>

Actuaries make use of statistics and mathematics formulas to create models for solving business problems. They are involved in pricing and management of investments and use their understanding of insurance, pension and other liabilities to manage the assets. In the insurance sector, they create price policies to ensure that insurers have the money to cover claims. They help in designing and advising on pension plans also.<br>

<br>
Actuarial work is about quantifying the risk and financial value of an uncertain future while accountants deal with past financial data.<br>

<p>Actuaries will be needed to develop, price, and evaluate a variety of insurance products and calculate the costs of new risks.</p>

<p>More actuaries will also be needed to help companies manage their own risk, a practice known as enterprise risk management. Actuaries will help companies avoid, manage, and respond to any potential financial risks across all areas of their business operations. This analysis helps companies adjust their business or investment strategies to achieve economic returns and respond to new financial regulations and requirements.</p>

<p>Insurance companies will need actuaries to analyze the large amount of information, such as medical or property data, collected from consumers. The increase in available data will allow insurance companies to better develop new products, set competitive prices, predict consumer behavior, and make more accurate projections of future risks and costs.</p>

<p>In addition, health insurance companies will require more actuaries to help evaluate the effects of changing healthcare regulations and guidelines, expand into new insurance markets, and offer products to new customers.</p>
