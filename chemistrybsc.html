Research and development is one of the most sought after and prospective career avenues for a chemist. It could be in any of the several industries like textiles, food industry, pharmaceutical, fertiliser, paint or cosmetic industry. In near future, most of the career opportunities will come from Pharmaceutical and Bioprocess industry like Food industry.<br>
<br>
Chemists will also find increasing opportunities in diverse fields like Biotechnology, Leather processing, Sugar technology, Plastic engineering, Pulp and paper technology, Oceanography and other related fields.<br>
<br>
With the manufacture and use of almost 50,000 different chemical substances, chemical scientists have a challenging future.<br>
<br>
1) Graduate/postgraduates in chemistry can work in industries manufacturing textiles, petroleum products, rubber, tyre, plastics, agricultural products, papers, pharmaceutical, food, fertilizers, paints, cement and even in cosmetic and other aromatic product manufacturing industries. Jobs are mainly in their analytical process laboratories and quality control laboratories. One can also get involved in product development or basic developmental research in these companies.<br>
<br>
2) The electronic, paper and pulp, metal, cement and aerospace industries also offer employment opportunities for a chemist.<br>
<br>
3) Chemical scientists also find opportunity for work in water treatment, sanitary and sewage treatment plants.<br>
<br>
4) Food chemistry and technology incorporates the work chemists do in food flavouring, pet foods and food preservatives. These are the developing areas for research and production.<br>
<br>
5) Postgraduates/graduates from the field of chemistry work in sales, marketing and management, patent and product liability law, chemicals business market research and public policy. Those with a Ph D are encountered in research labs.<br>
<br>
6) Army recruits women candidates for the Army Service Corps as Food scientists. Candidates are required to have a post graduate degree in organic chemistry/biochemistry of foods. Graduates in chemistry are enrolled for the Army Ordinance Corps.<br>
<br>
7) Chemists and chemical engineers are employed in consultancy firms to provide specialist guidance in areas related to their research specialty.<br>
<br>
8) Chemistry researchers work in museums in art conservation and restoration, carbon-dating and in analysing the genuineness of artifacts through chemical procedures.<br>
<br>
9) Forensic chemists work in forensic laboratories for crime detection.<br>
<br>
10) Toxicologists are chemists studying the harmful influence of chemicals on biological systems. They find work in research organisations and University departments.<br>
<br>
11) Many chemists find opportunities in University departments in teaching and research jobs.<br>
