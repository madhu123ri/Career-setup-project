Chemical Engineering combines the principles of mathematics, chemistry, physics and even biology with engineering practices in order to improve the human environment. Chemical engineers invent, develop, design, operate and manage processes (conversion of raw materials into finished products) in industries. They play key roles in industries as varied as petroleum, petrochemicals, food, materials, speciality chemicals, power production, environmental control, waste management and biotechnology.<br>
<br>
1) Petroleum companies like BPCL, ONGC, Chemical companies like BASF, and pharmaceutical companies like GlaxoSmithline and Ranbaxy are the traditional employers of chemical engineers<br>
<br>
2) Increasing numbers of chemical engineers are hired today in almost all sections of the industry including pharmaceuticals, healthcare, design and construction, pulp and paper, petrochemicals, food processing, specialty chemicals, microelectronics, electronic and advanced materials, polymers, business services, biotechnology, environmental health and safety industries, rubber, metal, cement, plastic, and aerospace industries<br>
<br>
3) Government agencies, such as the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency also hire chemical engineers<br>
<br>
4) A huge number of chemical engineers are working in biotechnology firms like Dr. Kiran Mazumdarâ€™s Biocon ,Shanta Biotechnics, National Immunological Ltd etc<br>
<br>
5) Chemical engineers also work in manufacturing. Specifically, chemical engineers improve food processing techniques, and methods of producing fertilizers, to increase the quantity and quality of available food<br>
